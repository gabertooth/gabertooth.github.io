__Project Background:__ The following Jupyter Notebook uses different classification machine learning modeling techniques to try and correctly identify a NBA players position based off of their physical traits and game stats. Due to the NBA shifting into a position-less basketball style of play, I thought it would be interesting to apply statistical python code to solve this problem. 

__Approach:__ The approach is simple, take data obtained from a kaggle open source data set that dates back to 1950 up until the 2017 NBA season. Using this data I will create four different types of models (KNN, SVM, RandomForest, Adaboost) and try to optimize each model using the modeling techniques learned in module 5. 

A __OSEMN framework__ was followed for this project:  

__Obtain:__ the data from the relevant resources and stakeholders  
__Scrub:__ Cleaning the data into formats that can be digested in Python packages such as Sklearn or Statsmodels Remember the "Garbage in, garbage out".  
__Explore:__ Using statistical methods and data analytic techniques explore the data to find significant patterns or trends  
__Model:__ Construct models to predict and forecast the data. Here we focus on our target variable which is price!  
__Interpret:__ Take the results of the analysis and model and create meaningful visualizations or presentations


This project was eye opening. It cemented many of the Machine Learning techniques learned throughout module 5. I truly believe I have both a technical and fundamental grasp on the following models, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM. I finally got to choose a topic for a project. Of course I chose the NBA. I am a very passionate Lebron James fan and will always say he is the GOAT. Anyway, I thought it would be perfect to classify NBA positions especially in the era of positionless basketball we see in todays game.
