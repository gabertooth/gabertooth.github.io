Over the past week I have struggled very hard with something. That something would be imposter syndrome both in searching for a job using the required money back job requirements and daily coding. First, I will touch on the job search. Through looking on LinkedIn and other job boards I have very quickly come to realize that the job search is going to be very difficult. I thought with my three years of consulting experience I would easily be able to land a job in either the tech or consulting world after putting Python and SQL on my resume. That would prove to be false. I realize now; the competition is very very tough. There are people with master’s and PhD’s degrees while I just have a BS degree. It has brought some light on my next steps and me realizing eventually I will probably want to go back to school. Although, first I would like to get a job in the field for at least a year or two. Nevertheless, I need to keep fighting and keep pushing. This is where the grit comes in. I have a goal and I will achieve that goal eventually. Great things take time. 

On to the next topic, general coding. While working on a self-started project about NCAA basketball I started to really struggle with trying to create some metadata from a DataFrame. Essentially, I wanted to create a new column that would calculate the win streak or losing streak of a team to then be used in predicting whether a team would cover the spread. I worked on it for a day or so and finally found a work around. What is the point of all this? Well I just wanted to give up and sometimes feel like a fraud when I am coding because I have less experience than most. This is the classic developer paradigm of learning a new language. There are peaks and valleys where you think you know everything and are un-stoppable, which I am still waiting for this day. As of now I am still in the valley, but on the climb to mastery. At the end of the day I need to keep pushing through the working and learning pains. I can do this, and I will do this!
