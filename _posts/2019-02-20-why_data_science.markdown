Why Data Science? There are plenty of other tech heavy cash cow indsutries? Why not web development or a developer in a ancient field like Cobalt? Data Science is the future in many ways.  Just imagine a world where AI robots are running around your house helping you do daily activites like laundry or dishes. Now lets take a step back, picture your daily life right now.  You may be asking yourself why I just ran you through these exercises.  Let me tell you.  The biggest commonality between these two worlds is data.  Data? Yes, data.  Data was being collected constantly by the robots sweeping and mopping your floors. Whether it is the dimensions of the room being swept. Data is everywhere and it sure is going no where.

Hi, my name is Gabe Blatstein.  I graduated from Penn State in 2016 with a degree in Finance and a minor in Economics.  I have worked in the consulting industry since graduation.  Starting out I worked for Grant Thornton doing public sector consulting for Customs Border Protection working on a Business Process Reengineering project.  Within the past six months, I switched to a company called CAPCO specializing in the financial services consulting world.  I am now on an Identity Access Management project and have worked on other project management engagements at a large mortgage company. Throughout my short career I have been yearning for something more than just my 9AM-5PM job. I was missing some form of continuing education. I started to look into coding about a year ago due to the show Mr. Robot.  Since college, I have always been facinated by code and I finally decided to learn some.

Fast forward a year and here we are. I enrolled in the online part time data science program to gain a competitive edge in the consulting idnustry and to learn a valuable skill for the future.  As I said before, data is everywhere and I believe there are a lot of companies out there not properly using said data.  I want to help people make statistically significant connections between their data and business. I would love to continue in the consulting industry to do this, or even make a complete career switch to a new industry. Data is here to stay and so am I.
